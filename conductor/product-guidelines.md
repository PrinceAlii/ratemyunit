# Product Guidelines

## Brand & Voice
- **Tone:** Friendly & Relatable. The platform should sound conversational and student-focused, making it feel accessible and trustworthy to the university community rather than like a rigid institutional tool.
- **Voice:** Accessible and engaging. Avoid overly academic jargon where possible, focusing on clear, helpful communication that resonates with the student experience.

## Visual Identity
- **Aesthetic:** Neo-Brutalist. Embrace high contrast, bold borders, vibrant colors, and raw typography. This design system should feel modern, energetic, and distinct from typical corporate or university interfaces.
- **Design System:** Utilize `shadcn/ui` and Tailwind CSS to maintain consistency while adhering to Neo-Brutalist principles (e.g., hard shadows, thick borders).

## User Experience (UX)
- **High Feedback:** Every user action must be acknowledged. Use toast notifications for success/error states, loading spinners for background processes, and confirmation dialogs for destructive actions.
- **Mobile-First:** Prioritize the mobile experience. Many students will access reviews on-the-go or during enrollment sessions; the interface must be fully responsive and touch-friendly.
- **Low Friction:** Keep the path from search to review-reading as short as possible.

## Accessibility & Performance
- **Performance-Focused Accessibility:** The platform must remain functional on low-bandwidth connections and older devices. Optimize asset sizes and ensure core functionality is available without heavy client-side processing where possible.
- **Standard Compliance:** Aim for high contrast and legible typography as part of the Neo-Brutalist style, which naturally supports visual accessibility.
