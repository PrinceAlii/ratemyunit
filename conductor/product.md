# Initial Concept

RateMyUnit is an open-source platform designed to aggregate and standardize student reviews for university subjects across Australia. It aims to solve the problem of fragmented feedback by providing a centralized, searchable database of subject ratings, workload estimates, and qualitative reviews.

The platform is built to be scalable and agnostic, supporting multiple universities through a configurable scraping engine that adapts to different handbook architectures (CourseLoop, Akari, legacy HTML).
